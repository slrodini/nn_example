### Slides
The slides for the lectures are in the `Notes` folder. If you do not have LaTeX install, just open the PDF in any editor.
### Code
1. A jupyter notebook is available under the `Code/lecture_1` to solve the heat equation numerically and plot the results
2. A Windows pre-compiled executable is available in the same directory to play around with the bit representation for a floating point (32 bit) number
3. The code for the neural networks is available in `Code\nn`. There is no Windows support for the moment.
